# Dexie

Dexie is a slides app that doesn't suck. It focuses on speed, great defaults, and a clean editing experience for building beautiful decks quickly.

Future direction: add AI features that can agentically draft and refine slide decks, while keeping humans in control of the final result.

## Local development

Install dependencies with `pnpm install` (or `npm install`).

Run the development server with `pnpm dev` (or `npm run dev`).
